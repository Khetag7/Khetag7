### üë®‚Äçüíª Me

Hi! My name is Khetag, and I've been studying frontend development for three years. I want to become a professional frontend developer. During this time, my portfolio has accumulated over 20+ pet projects, some of which are already online. I studied on my own, taught programming with a mentor, worked freelance for a long time, worked for a company for a couple of months, and also worked briefly at a web studio. I've been developing projects/websites with a team for over a year, have a wide range of technologies and skills, am well-versed in technology, a quick learner, and always happy to meet new people. I'm currently looking for work and would be happy to chat with you!
