### About Me

Hello! My name is Khetag, I have been studying Frontend development for 3 years. I'm passionate about becoming a skilled Frontend developer, and during this time my portfolio has accumulated more than 20+ projects, some of which are already live on the Internet.

I'm primarily self-taught but have also learned with mentors, and have even taught programming to others. I've worked mostly as a freelancer, with some experience in companies and web studios. I've collaborated on team projects for over a year and have experience with numerous technologies.

I'm proficient with modern web technologies, learn quickly, and always enjoy meeting new people. Currently, I'm seeking new opportunities and would be happy to connect with you!
